            <h3>Yiftch Samocha</h3>
            <p>Yiftach Samocha started his coding journey by hacking his school's vending machine to
                dispense unlimited chocolate bars. Since then, he’s mastered JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS,
                all while drinking cold coffee at 3 AM. Yiftach’s proudest title is "Chief Bug Creator"
                at top tech firms, where he made user interfaces as confusing as possible.
                In his spare time, he organizes digital cat photos and dreams of creating an app
                that makes his bed every morning.</p>

                Fluent in C++ to JavaScript, Asaf excels at writing "Hello World" in every language.
                His career highlights include creating a social media platform for goldfish and translating
